After teaching for years, I got tired of updating my lecture notes when changing systems and word processors.  I worked in WordPerfect to Microsoft Word to LibreOffice, and maybe a few others in between.  No LaTeX?  It seemed like a nice idea, but I wasn't aware of any convenient PC-based system.

That has changed, so this is my attempt to future-proof the notes.  Various shell scripts grab the text out of the notes, convert them to Markdown for permanent storage, and process them into PDF packages with everything needed for the night.

Right now, it's a hodge-podge of small scripts tuned specifically for my existing setup, but hopefully will be generalized and modernized quickly.
